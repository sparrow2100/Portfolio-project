          <p class="bio">
            Claire was handed a tiny violin at the age of three to help her
            express herself, and never put it down. She has since graduated from
            the enthusiastic squeaks of a toy-sized violin to performance which
            has been described as having a range of expressivity both sensitive
            and powerful. In her teenage years, Claire acted as concertmaster of
            Lethbridge Alberta's youth string ensemble Sinfonia Allegro,
            performed in the Lethbridge Symphony Orchestra for three years,
            played in a masterclass for world-renowned violist Rivka Golani, and
            was invited to perform with the Regina Chamber Strings in the
            Stirling Bridge International Arts Festival in Scotland. More
            recently, Claire has completed a Bachelor of Music at the University
            of Victoria with a Major in Musicology and Sound Studies and a minor
            in Anthropology. In her studies she focused on the interactions
            between classical music, gender, and culture. She is passionate
            about taking steps to transform the classical world, making it more
            accessible and relevant by using music of marginalized composers,
            and creating a healthy, exploratory, and low pressure environment to
            help students succeed. While violin is her main instrument, she also
            plays the viola, clarinet and piano, and is learning the baroque
            violin. Since graduating from UVic, Claire has spent her time
            teaching violin and learning to code through platforms such as
            Codecademy and SheCodes.
